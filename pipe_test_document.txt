Testing pipe symbol fix:

1. Single pipe: |
2. Pipe in quotes: "|"
3. Multiple pipes: |||
4. Text with pipes: hello|world|test
5. Pipe with spaces: | symbol |
6. Normal text for comparison: symbol

Select each line above and press Ctrl+Shift+M to test the menu functionality.
The text replacement should work correctly for all cases now.
