## Test Steps to Verify Fix:

### 1. **Initial State Check** ✅

- Active menu items should be visible
- Global hotkey should be registered

### 2. **Navigation Test** 🔄
- Navigate to **Menu Manager** screen
- Stay there for a few seconds
- Navigate back to **Main** screen
- **Expected Result**: Status should remain green with "Ready"

### 3. **Multiple Navigation Test** 🔄🔄
- Navigate: Main → Menu Manager → System Status → Main
- Navigate: Main → Phase 3 Demo → Main  
- Navigate: Main → Activity → Settings → Main
- **Expected Result**: Each return to Main should show green "Ready" status

### 4. **Context Menu Test After Navigation** ⌨️
After any navigation back to Main:
- Open external text editor (VS Code, gedit, etc.)

### 5. **Test Action Test After Navigation** 🧪

- **Expected Result**: Should work without errors

## 🐛 **Previous Issue:**
- Navigation away and back would show **red icon** 
- Service Status would show **"Initializing..."**

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**
- Proper stream subscription management

- No re-initialization when already initialized

## 📱 **What to Look For:**

- **Red Icon**: System has issues
- **"Ready" Status**: Service is operational
- **"Initializing..." Status**: Service is starting/broken
- **Working Hotkey**: Ctrl+Shift+M responds
